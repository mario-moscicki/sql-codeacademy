SQL knowledge to complete real-world projects.

Option 1: Reputable Product Agency (RPA) has started receiving complaints from their credit card processor about fraudulent transactions. Help their finance department identify potentially risky transactions before they finish processing.  
2: Find the full_names and emails of the transactions listing 20252 as the zip code.  
3: The fraudsters thought it would be funny to use ‘Art Vandelay’ for their full name or add a ‘der’ for their middle name. Use a query to find the names and emails associated with these transactions.  
4: For example, any IP address beginning with ‘10.’ is reserved for internal use. We shouldn’t see IP addresses like this accessing Reputable Company’s service. Find the ip_addresses and emails listed with these transactions.  
5: Find the emails in transaction_data with ‘temp_email.com’ as a domain.  
6: The finance department is looking for a specific transaction. They know that the transaction occurred from an ip address starting with ‘120.’ and their full name starts with ‘John’. Can you find the transaction?  

Option 2: The marketing department of RPA is looking to segment the company users by a number of different criteria. You can help them find key demographics.  
2: Find the email addresses and birthdays of users whose birthday is between 1980-01-01 and 1989-12-31.  
3: Find the emails and creation date of users whose created_at date matches this condition.  
4: Find the emails of the users who received the ‘bears’ test.  
5: Find all the emails of all users who received a campaign on website BBB.  
6: Find all the emails of all users who received ad copy 2 in their campaign.  
7: Find the emails for all users who received both a campaign and a test. These users will have non-empty entries in the campaign and test columns.

Option 3: Davie’s Burgers is a good old mom-and-pop restaurant looking to place a subway ad that will catch people’s attention. Help them dig into their orders table to find a funny tagline!
