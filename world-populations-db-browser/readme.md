This project is a bit different than the previous ones, there is no step by step tutorial.  

Project goals  
I have worked with the world population dataset by country in recent years. I wrote inquiries to get interesting data and answer a set of detailed questions.  

I decided to do this project on my computer. I downloaded 'ready to use' database to my computer. Then I installed and launched DB Browser for SqLite.  

Project Requirements:  
3. What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).
