This project is a bit different than all of them, there is no step by step tutorial.  

Project goals  
I have worked with the world population dataset by country in recent years. I wrote inquiries to get interesting data and answer a set of detailed questions.  

I decided to do this project on my computer. I downloaded the finished database to my computer. Then I installed and launched DB Browser for SqLite.  

Project Requirements:
3. What years are covered by the dataset? (you can manually count the number of years returned).
4. What is the largest population size for Gabon in this dataset?  
5. What were the 10 lowest population countries in 2005?  
6. What are all the distinct countries with a population of over 100 million in the year 2010?  
7. How many countries in this dataset have the word “Islands” in their name?  
8. What is the difference in population between 2000 and 2010 in Indonesia?
