This is first contact with SQL. I learned how to use SQL to access, create, and update data stored in a database.

In order to exercisecreate I create my friends table and tryed add/delete data from it

My job was:
- Create a table named friends with three columns:  
ID that stores INTEGER,
NAME that stores TEXT,
BIRTHDAY that stores DATE.

- Add Jane Doe to table friends. Her birthday was May 30th, 1990.

- Add another two of my friends to the table and insert birthday whatever I want.

- One day Jane Doe get married! Her new last name is “Smith”. So I must changed name in FRIENDS.
