I worked with a dataset of world population by country data from recent years. 
Wrote queries to retrieve interesting data and answer a set of specific questions:
- How many entries in the countries table are from Africa?
- What was the total population of the continent of Oceania in 2005?
- What is the average population of countries in South America in 2003?
- What country had the smallest population in 2007?
- What is the average population of Poland during the time period covered by this dataset?
- How many countries have the word “The” in their name?
- What was the total population of each continent in 2010?
