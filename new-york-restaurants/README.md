Hi,  
in project New York Restaurants I was practicing the most common types of queries.  
I've learned how to query data from a database using SQL, also learned how to filter queries to make the information more specific and useful.  
First I took all data from database and checked what I have there:

They asked me / filtered data by:  
- What are the distinct neighborhoods?    
- What are the distinct cuisine types?    
- I was supposed to check who would like some Chinese takeout.  
- Checked all the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above.  
- Suppose Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date and then return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$.  
- I had to find the name of restaurant where x person was, the only thing he remembered was a ‘meatball’ word.  
- I Created a Top 10 Restaurants Ranking based on reviews.

- I used a CASE statement to change the rating system for each review score
