Hi,  
in project New York Restaurants I practiced wrote the most common types of queries.  
I'm learned how to query data from a database using SQL, also learned how to filter queries to make the information more specific and useful.  
First im take all data from data base and watch what im there had

They asked me / filtered data by:  
- What are the distinct neighborhoods?  - What are the distinct cuisine types?  - I'm supposed who would like some Chinese takeout.  
- Watched all the restaurants with reviews of 4 and above.  
- Supposed Abbi and Ilana want to have a fancy dinner date. and then return all the restaurants that are Italian and $$$.  
- I had to find the name of restaurant where he been, he only know part of word ‘meatball’.  
- I Created a Top 10 Restaurants Ranks based on reviews.

- I used a CASE statement to change the rating system for each review score
