Code Challenge: Aggregate Functions
I helped the Codeflix streaming video site analyze some of their customer data using SQL aggregates.
A streaming video company, Codeflix, needs my help, analyzing their user data. They they sent me a portion of their dataset into the SQL workspace for this lesson.

The database contains 3 tables:
- users contains the basic account details for each user
- payments contains payment details for a 3 month period
- watch_history contains watch events for the users
